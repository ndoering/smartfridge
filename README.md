# Project 'Smartfridge'
### Systems and Software Engineering - Winter Term 2017
### Prepared by Liuba, Nils, JÃ¶rn, Chris

### Hi everyone!
This is a project to make your fridge smarter.
Current setup:
A RaspberryPi takes a picture of your fridge content. It can also be triggered over a web interface, where you can access the latest statistics on your consumption. If there is a bad banana in your fridge, you get notified in a slack channel. See all requirements in the [corresponding documentation](documents/requirements.md).

### Contribute
Please feel free to contribute.
Use or open a branch for software development. Master is only meant for documentation updates.

Check the [Software Design Document](documents/SoftwareDesignDocument.md) for details.
