# Project 'Smartfridge'

## Systems and Software Engineering - Winter Term 2017

### Prepared by Melanie, Liuba, Nils, JÃ¶rn, Chris

Hi everyone!  Please feel free to contribute.   
I moved the requirements specs to the [requirements.md](https://github.com/ndoering/smartfridge/blob/master/documents/requirements.md) as the README is more an overall document on the whole project.

**ToDos (to be continued):**

- [x] Please elaborate about a valid feature hierachy and add them underneath in the first place. *see requirements.md*
- [ ] Please replace the generic sections in [requirements.md](https://github.com/ndoering/smartfridge/blob/master/documents/requirements.md) with our details to the project whereever you can. Cross out the sections you have replaced.
